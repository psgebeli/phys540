A linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields
a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with a discontinuous
piecewise linear equation. The method represents one of the oldest and
best-known pseudorandom number generator algorithms. The theory
behind them is relatively easy to understand, and they are easily
implemented and fast, especially on computer hardware which can provide
modular arithmetic by storage-bit truncation.

The generator is defined by recurrence relation:

    X_{n+1} = (a*X_n + c) mod m 

where X is the sequence of pseudorandom values, and

    m   : 0 < m       — the "modulus"
    a   : 0 < a < m   — the "multiplier"
    c   : 0 ≤ c < m   — the "increment"
    X_0 : 0 ≤ X 0 < m

Donald Knuth's example
m = 2^{64}
a = 6364136223846793005
c = 1442695040888963407

This is my submission for the final project in Phys 540. The project is written in python and provides a simulation of the solar system using physics to drive the planet's motion.

Pygame and numpy are used, which can be installed via 

pip install pygame 

and 

pip install numpy 

respectively (assuming the user has python 3 installed).

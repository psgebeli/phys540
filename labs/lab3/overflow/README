This is pretty easy to convince myself of. Assuming that column1 is
float, 2 is double, and 3 is long double, it is easily seen by piping
the results of ./max into a data file and using more to scroll. the
first column starts spitting out infinity at 10^38, 2nd at 10^308, and
3rd at 10^4932, implying that those are the largest finite values for
the respective types.

There is no assignment for this part, right? Just convincing ourselves
of that fact? [ksdb: Correct]

it is clear that the descending summation holds better precision for
high N, since the ascending summation tapers off at 15.4037, while the
descending some continues.

This is (probably) because in the descending summation, you start with
smaller terms (1/10mil) compared to 1/10. Starting smaller is always
better, because starting bigger can lead to float-rounding errors.

For example, a=1000, b = c = 14

a + b = 1014 --> 1010
(a+b)+c = 1010+14 = 1024 --> 1020

but b+c = 28
a + (b+c) = 1000 + 28 = 1028 --> 1030

so starting smaller leads to better precision.

# python !! the language I am best at !!

# again, store a as the character k

a = 'k'

# a is currently a string. so if we use the ord() function to convert a into its associated
# integer, then add 1 to that integer, then use chr() to convert that integer back into
# its associated string, we get an l

a = chr(ord(a)+1)

# print it (python requires pluses between different types)
print("He"+a+"lo World!")
